      <t>
	This memo describes research challenges for
	Information-Centric Networking. Information-Centric Networking
	is an approach to evolve the Internet infrastructure to
	directly support information distribution by introducing
	uniquely named data as a core Internet principle.  Data
	becomes independent from location, application, storage, and
	means of transportation, enabling in-network caching and
	replication. Challenges include naming, security, routing,
	system scalability, mobility management, wireless networking,
	transport services, in-network caching, and network
	management.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Distributing and manipulating named information is a major
	application in the Internet today. In addition to web-based
	content distribution, other distribution technologies (such as
	P2P and CDN) have emerged and are promoting a communication
	model of accessing data by name, regardless of origin server
	location.
      </t>
      <t>
	In order to respond to increasing traffic volume in the
	current Internet for applications such as mobile video and
	cloud computing, a set of disparate technologies and
	distribution services are applied that employ caching,
	replication and content distribution in different specific
	ways. These approaches are currently deployed in separate
	silos -- different CDN providers and P2P applications rely on
	their own, often proprietary, distribution technologies. It is
	not possible to uniquely and securely identify named
	information independently of the distribution channel; and the
	different distribution approaches are typically implemented as
	an overlay, potentially leading to unnecessary inefficiency.
      </t>
      <t>
	For example, creating and sharing multimedia content in a
	social networking application today, typically requires
	uploading data objects to centralized service provider
	platforms, from where it can be accessed individually by other
	users. Even if content sharing is intended to happen locally,
	e.g., in a local network or local area, the actual
	communication will require interactions from any interested
	user with the service provider. CDNs can alleviate the
	situation only partly, because, due to organizational and
	economic reasons, it is not common to deploy CDN gear
	ubiquitously. Moreover, since CDNs and the respective communication
	sessions form overlays, the actual communication, i.e., the
	requests for named content and the actual responses, are
	largely invisible to the network, i.e., it is not easily
	possible to optimize efficiency and performance. For example
	in a wireless access network, it is not possible to leverage
	the inherent broadcast nature of the medium (and avoid duplicate
	transmission of the same content) due to limitations from
	point-to-point and overlay communication.
      </t>
      <t>
	Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve
	the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by
	introducing named data as a core network-layer primitive. Data
	objects become independent of location, application, storage,
	and means of transportation, allowing for inexpensive and
	ubiquitous in-network caching and replication. The expected
	benefits are improved efficiency, better support for
	provenance verification and name-content binding validation,
	better scalability with respect to information/bandwidth
	demand and better robustness in challenging communication
	scenarios.
      </t>
      <t>
	ICN concepts can be deployed by retooling the protocol stack:
	name-based data access can be implemented on top of the
	existing IP infrastructure, e.g., by providing resource
	naming, ubiquitous caching and corresponding transport
	services, or it can be seen as a packet-level internetworking
	technology that would cause fundamental changes to Internet
	routing and forwarding. In summary, ICN is expected to evolve
	the Internet architecture towards a network model that is more
	suitable for the current and future usage patterns.
      </t>
      <t>
	This document presents the ICN research challenges that need
	to be addressed in order to achieve these goals. These research
	challenges are seen from a technical perspective, although 
	business relationships between Internet players will also
	influence developments in this area. We leave business
	challenges for a separate document, however. The objective
	of this note is to document the technical challenges and
	corresponding current approaches and to expose requirements
	that should be addressed by future research work.
      </t>

    </section>

    <section title="Problems with Information Distribution Today">
      <t>
	The best current practice to manage the above-mentioned growth
	in terms of data volume and number of devices is to increase
	infrastructure investment, employ application-layer overlays
	such as CDNs, P2P applications, and M2M application platforms
	that cache content, provide location-independent access to
	data, and optimize its delivery. In principle, such platforms
	provide a service model of accessing named data objects (NDOs)
	(e.g., replicated web resources, M2M data in data centers)
	instead of a host-to-host packet delivery service model.</t>
	
	<t>
	  However, since this functionality resides in overlays only,
	  the full potential of content distribution and M2M
	  application platforms cannot be leveraged as the network is
	  not aware of data requests and data transmissions. This has
	  the following impact:
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      data traffic typically follows sub-optimal paths as it
	      is effectively routed depending on the overlay topology
	      instead of the Internet layer topology;
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      network capabilities, such as multicast and broadcast,
	      are largely underutilized or not employed at all. As a
	      result, request and delivery for the same object have to
	      be made multiple times;
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      overlays typically require significant infrastructure
	      support, e.g., authentication portals, content storage,
	      and applications servers, making it often impossible to
	      establish local, direct communication;
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      since the network is not aware of the nature of data
	      objects, it is unable to manage access and transmission
	      (without layer violations);
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      provenance validation uses host authentication today. As
	      such, even if there are locally cached copies available,
	      it is normally not easily possible to validate their
	      authenticity; and
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      many applications follow their own approach to caching,
	      replication, transport, authenticity validation (if at
	      all), although they all share similar models for
	      accessing named data objects in the network.

	      </t>
	      <t hangText="Requestor:">Entitiy in an ICN network that
	      is sending a request for a Named Data Object to the
	      network.
	      </t>
	    </list>
	  </t>

	</section>

	<section title="Concepts" anchor="sec.concepts">
	  <t>
	    Fundamentally, ICN is providing access to named data as a
	    first-order network service, i.e., the network is able to
	    serve requests to named data natively. That means, network
	    nodes can receive requests for named data and act as
	    necessary, for example, by forwarding the request to a
	    suitable next-hop. Consequently, the network processes
	    requests for named data objects (and corresponding
	    responses) natively. Every network node on a path is
	    enabled to perform forwarding decisions, to cache objects
	    etc.  This enables the network to forward such requests on
	    optimal paths, employing the best transmission
	    technologies at every node, e.g., broadcast/multicast
	    transmission in wireless networks to avoid duplicate
	    transmission of both requests and responses.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    In ICN there is a set of common concepts and node
	    requirements beyond this basic service model. Naming data
	    objects is a key concept. In general, ICN names represent
	    neither network nodes nor interfaces -- they represent
	    NDOs independently of their location. Names do play a key
	    role in forwarding decisions and are used for matching
	    requests to responses: In order to provide better support
	    for accessing copies of NDOs regardless of their location,
	    it is important to be able to validate that a response
	    actually delivers the bits that correspond to an original
	    request for named data.
	  </t>

	      Internet Protocol,". ICN is not a protocol.</t></list></t>
	      <t>Dirk: OK</t>
	      
	  -->
	  <t>
	    Name-content binding validation is a fundamental security
	    service in ICN, and this is often achieved by establishing
	    a verifiable binding between the object name and the
	    actual object or an identity that has created the
	    object. ICN can support other security services, such as
	    provenance validation, encryption -- depending on the
	    details of naming schemes, object models and assumptions
	    on infrastructure support. Security services such as
	    name-content binding validation are available to any node,
	    i.e., not just the actual receivers. This is an important
	    feature, for enabling ingress gateways to check object
	    authenticity to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Based on these fundamental properties it is possible to
	    leverage network storage ubiquitously: every node and
	    every device can cache data objects and respond to
	    requests for such objects -- it is not required to
	    validate the authenticity of the node itself since
	    name-content bindings can be validated. Ubiquitous
	    in-network storage can be used for different purposes: it
	    can enable sharing, i.e., the same object copy can be
	    delivered to multiple users/nodes as in today's proxy
	    caches and CDNs. It can also be used to make communication
	    more robust (and perform better) by enabling the network
	    to answer requests from local caches (instead of from
	    origin servers). In case of disruption (message not
	    delivered), a node can re-send the request, and it could
	    be answered by an on-path cache, i.e., on the other side
	    of the disrupted link. The network itself would thus
	    support retransmissions -- enabling shorter round-trip
	    times and offloading origin servers and other parts of the
	    network.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    The request/response model and ubiquitous in-network
	    storage also enable new options for implementing
	    transport services, i.e., reliable transmission, flow
	    control, etc. First of all, a request/response model can
	    enable receiver-driven transport regimes, i.e., receivers
	    (the requestors of NDOs) can control message sending rates
	    by regulating the request sending rate (assuming that
	    every response message has to be triggered by a request
	    message). Retransmission would be achieved by re-sending
	    requests, e.g., after a timeout. Because objects can be
	    replicated, object transmission and transport sessions
	    would not necessarily have end-to-end semantics: requests
	    can be answered by caches, and a node can select one or
	    multiple next-hop destinations for a particular request --
	    depending on configuration, observed performance or other
	    criteria.
	  </t>

	    <t hangText="***KP Comment:"><vspace />I do not get why

            <t>Dirk: receiver-driven transport is something that ICN

	    <t>
	      This receiver-driven communication model potentially
	      enables new interconnection and business models: a

	      requestor (or requesting network) in data from another
	      peer, which could suggest modeling peering agreements

      <section title="Naming and data authenticity" anchor="sec.naming">

	<t>
	  Naming data objects is as important for ICN as naming hosts
	  is for today's Internet. Fundamentally, ICN requires unique
	  names for individual NDOs, since names are used for
	  identifying objects independently of their location or
	  container.  In addition, since NDOs can be cached anywhere,
	  the origin cannot be trusted anymore hence the importance to
	  establish a verifiable binding between the object and its
	  name (name-data integrity) so that a receiver can be sure
	  that the received bits do correspond to the NDO originally
	  requested (object authenticity).  Information about an
	  object's provenance, i.e., who generated or published it, is
	  also useful to associate to the name.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The above functions are fundamentally required for the
	  information-centric network to work reliably, otherwise
	  neither network elements nor receivers can trust object
	  authenticity. Lack of this trust enables several attacks
	  including DoS attacks by injecting spoofed content into the
	  network. There are different ways to use names and
	  cryptography to achieve the desired functions <xref
	  target="ICNNAMING"/> <xref target="ICNSURVEY"/>, and there
	  are different ways to manage namespaces correspondingly.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Two types of naming schemes have been proposed in the ICN
	  literature: hierarchical and flat namespaces. For example, a
	  hierarchical scheme may have a structure similar to current
	  URIs, where the hierarchy is rooted in a publisher
	  prefix. Such hierarchy enables aggregation of routing
	  information, improving scalability of the routing system. In
	  some cases, names are human-readable, which makes it
	  possible for users to manually type in names, reuse, and, to
	  some extent, map the name to user intent.
	</t>
	<t>
	  The second general class of naming schemes follows a
	  "self-certifying" approach, meaning that the object's
	  name-data integrity can be verified without requiring a
	  public key infrastructure (PKI) or other third party to
	  first establish trust in the key. Self-certification is
	  achieved, e.g., by binding the hash of the NDO content to
	  the object's name. For instance, this can be done by
	  directly embedding the hash of the content in the
	  name. Another option is an indirect binding, which embeds
	  the public key of the publisher in the name and signs the
	  hash of the content with the corresponding secret key. The
	  resulting names are typically non-hierarchical, or flat,
	  although the publisher field could be employed to create a
	  structure which could facilitate route aggregation.  There
	  are several design trade-offs for ICN naming, which affect
	  routing and security. Self-certifying names are not human
	  readable nor hierarchical. They can however provide some
	  structure for aggregation, for instance, a name part
	  corresponding to a publisher.

	  Research challenges specific to naming include:
	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
	      naming static data objects can be performed by using
	      content hashes as part of object names, so that
	      publishers calculate the hash over existing data objects
	      and receivers (or any ICN node) can validate the
	      name-content binding by re-calculating the hash and
	      comparing it to the name (component). <xref
	      target="RFC6920"></xref> specifies a
	      concrete naming format for this.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      naming dynamic objects refers to use cases where the
	      name has to be generated before the object is
	      created. For example, this could be the case for live
	      streaming, when a publisher wants to make the stream
	      available by registering stream chunk names in the
	      network. One approach to this can be self-certified
	      names as described above.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      requestor privacy protection can be a challenge in ICN
	      as a direct consequence of the
	      accessing-named-data-objects paradigm: if the network
	      can "see" requests and responses, it can also log
	      request history for network segments or individual
	      users, which can be undesirable, especially since names
	      are typically expected to be long-lived. That is, even
	      if the name itself does not reveal much information, the
	      assumption is that the name can be used to retrieve the
	      corresponding data objects in the future.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Updating and versioning NDO can be challenging because
	      it can contradict fundamental ICN assumptions: if an NDO
	      can be replicated and stored in in-network storage for
	      later retrieval, names have to be long-lived -- and the
	      name-content binding must not change: updating an object
	      (i.e., changing the content without generating a new
	      name) is not possible. Versioning is one possible
	      solution, but requires a naming scheme that supports it
	      (and a way for requestors to learn about versions).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Managing accessibility: whereas in ICN the general
	      assumption is to enable ubiquitous access to NDOs, there
	      can be relevant use cases where access to objects should
	      be restricted, for example to a specific user
	      group. There are different approaches for this, such as
	      object encryption (requiring key distribution and
	      related mechanisms) or the concept of scopes, e.g.,
	      based on names that can only be used/resolved under some
	      constraints.

-->
	  
	  <t>
	    Security can take many different forms in ICN and instead
	    of discussing specific attacks or technical details, we
	    propose here the most important security challenges that come
	    from the shift to information-centric communications. Some
	    challenges are well-understood, and there are (sometimes
	    multiple different) approaches to address them, whereas
	    other challenges are active research and engineering
	    topics.
	  </t>
	  
	  <section title="Data Object Authentication">
	    <t>
	      As mentioned in section <xref target="sec.naming"/>,
	      data object authentication is an important ICN feature,
	      since ICN data objects are retrieved not only from an
	      original copy holder but also from any caching
	      point. Hence, the communication channel endpoints to
	      retrieve NDOs are not trustable anymore and solutions
	      widely used today such as TLS <xref target="RFC5246" />
	      cannot be used as a general solution. Since data objects
	      can be maliciously modified ICN should provide users
	      with a security mechanism to verify the origin and
	      integrity of the data object, and there are different
	      ways to achieve this.
	    </t>
	    
	    <t>
	      An efficient approach for static NDOs is providing a
	      name-content-binding by hashing an NDO and using the
	      hash as a part of the object's name.
	      <xref target="RFC6920" /> provides a mechanism and a
	      format for representing a digest algorithm and the
	      actual digest in a name (amongst other information).
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      For dynamic objects (where it is desirable to refer to
	      an NDO by name before the object has been created),
	      public-key cryptography is often applied, i.e., every
	      NDO would be authenticated by means of a signature
	      performed by the data object publisher so that any data
	      object consumer can verify the validity of the data
	      object based on the signature. However, in order to
	      verify the signature of an object, the consumer must
	      know the public key of the entity that signed the
	      object.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      One research challenge is then to support a mechanism to
	      distribute the publisher's public keys to the consumers
	      of data objects.  There are two main approaches to
	      achieve this; one is based on an external third party
	      authority such as hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure
	      (PKI) <xref target="RFC5280"/> and the other is to adapt a
	      self-certifying scheme. The former, as the name implies,
	      depends on an external third party authority to
	      distribute the public key of the publisher for the
	      consumers. In a self-certifying scheme, the public key
	      (or a hash of it) would be used as part of the name --
	      which is sufficient to validate the object's
	      authenticity.
	    </t>	      
	    <!-- On the other hand, in a self-certifying scheme, any
	         provider of the data object is responsible for
	         distributing the corresponding public key and the
	         necessary information to determine the data object
	         publisher, for example with a certificate, that can
	         be validated through the public key. Once the
	         certificate authenticated, its public key can be
	         used to authenticate the signed data object itself.
	         Data object authentication is potentially tightly
	         linked with naming. Alternatively, non PK-based
	         name-content-binding validation, like hash-based
	         name [RFC6920] can be adopted.
	    -->
	    <t>
	      In cases where information about the origin of a data
	      object is not available by other means, the object
	      itself would have to incorporate the necessary
	      information to determine the object publisher, for
	      example with a certificate, that can be validated
	      through the PKI. Once the certificate is authenticated,
	      its public key can be used to authenticate the signed
	      data object itself.
	    </t>
	      <!--Data object authentication is potentially tightly
	      linked with naming. -->
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="Binding NDOs to Real-World Identities">
	    <t>
	      In addition to validating NDO authenticity, it is still
	      important to bind real-world identities, e.g., a
	      publisher identity, to objects, so that a requestor can
	      verify that a received object was actually published by
	      a certain source.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      With hash-based and self-certifying names,
	      real-world-identity bindings are not intrinsically
	      established: the name provides the hash of the NDO or of
	      the public key that has been used to sign the NDO. There
	      needs to be another binding to a real-world-identity if
	      that feature is requested.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      If the object name directly provides the publisher name
	      and if that name is protected by a certificate that
	      links to PKI-like trust chain, the object name itself
	      can provide an intrinsic binding to a real-world
	      identity.
	    </t>
	    <!--	  <t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6">
	    <t hangText="***DKU Comment:"><vspace /> Not sure what the
	    conclusion is: in reality, this is all intrinsic to the
	    particular ICN approach.
    </t> -->
            <t>
	      Binding between NDOs and Real-World Identities is essential
	      but there is no universal way to achieve it as it is all
	      intrinsic to a particular ICN approach.
	    </t>
	  </section>

	  
	  <section title="Traffic aggregation and filtering">
	    <t>
	      One request message to retrieve a data object can
	      actually aggregate requests coming from several
	      consumers. This aggregation of requests reduces the
	      overall traffic but makes per-requestor filtering
	      harder.  The challenge in this case is to provide a
	      mechanism that allows request aggregation and
	      per-requestor filtering.  A possible solution is to
	      indicate the set of requestors in the aggregated request
	      such that the response can indicate the subset of
	      requestors allowed to access the data object. However,
	      this solution requires collaboration from other nodes in
	      the network and is not suitable for caching. Another
	      possible solution is to encrypt data objects and ensure
	      that only authorised consumers can decrypt them. This
	      solution does not preclude caching and does not require
	      collaboration from the network. However, it implies a
	      mechanism to generate group keys (e.g., different
	      private keys can be used to decrypt the same encrypted
	      data object) <xref target="Chaum" />.
	    </t>
	  </section>
	  
	  <section title="State overloading">
<!-- OLD
	    <t>
	      ICN solutions where intermediate routers need to keep
	      state, such as request origin or forwarding information,
	      to operate correctly (e.g., CCN <xref target="CCN"/>)
	      are subject to denial of service attacks
	      aiming to overload the router's internal state. The
	      challenge is then to provision routers and construct
	      internal state in a way that alleviates sensibility to
	      such attacks. The problem becomes even harder if the
	      protocol does not provide information about the origin
	      of messages. It is worth noting that data object caching
	      is also subject to such attacks but caching is only an
	      optimisation so in the worst case, performance would be
	      the same as if no caching was used.  To limit the impact
	      on attacks on caching, robust cache eviction algorithms
	      must be used.
	    </t>
-->
	    <t>
	      ICN solutions that implement state on intermediate
	      routers for request routing or forwarding (e.g., CCN
	      <xref target="CCN"/>) are subject to denial of service
	      attacks from overloading or superseding the internal
	      state of a router (e.g., 'interest flooding' <xref
	      target="BACKSCATTER"/>). Additionally, stateful
	      forwarding can enable attack vectors such as resource
	      exhaustion or complexity attacks to the routing
	      infrastructure. The challenge is then to provision
	      routers and construct internal state in a way that
	      alleviates sensibility to such attacks. The problem
	      becomes even harder, if the protocol does not provide
	      information about the origin of messages. Without
	      origin, it is a particular challenge to distinguish
	      between regular (intense) use and misuse of the
	      infrastructure.

	  <section title="Delivering data objects from replicas">
	    <!-- OLD
	    <t>
	      A challenge related to content management but that can
	      have impact on security is the potential lack of control
	      a data object producer has on its own data. For example,
	      how can a producer know the number of copies of its data
	      are in the network or who has consumed them?
	    </t>
-->
	    <t>
	      A common capability of ICN solutions is data replication
	      and in-network storage. Delivering replicated data
	      objects from caches decouples content consumption from
	      data sources, which leads to a loss of control on (1)
	      content access, and (2) content dissemination. In a
	      widely distributed, decentralized environment like the
	      Internet, this raises several challenges.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      One group of challenges is related to content
	      management. Without access control, a content provider
	      looses the means to count and survey content
	      consumption, to limit access scopes, to control or know
	      about the number of copies of its data in the network,
	      or to withdraw publication reliably. Any non-cooperative
	      or desynchronized data cache may hinder an effective
	      content management policy.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Another group of challenges arises from potential
	      traffic amplifications in the decoupled environment. ICN
	      solutions that attempt to retrieve content from several
	      replicas in parallel, or decorrelated network routing
	      states, but also distributed attackers may
	      simultaneously initiate the transmission of content from
	      multiple replicas towards the same destination (e.g.,
	      'initiated overloads' or 'blockades' <xref
	      target="BACKSCATTER"/>). Methods for mitigating such
	      threats need rigorous forwarding checks that require
	      alignment with caching procedures (e.g., on-path or
	      off-path).
	    </t>

	  </section>

	  <section title="Cryptographic robustness">
	    <t>
	      Content producers sign their content to ensure the integrity of
	      data and to allow for data object authentication. This is a
	      fundamental requirement in ICN due to distributed caching.
	      Publishers, who (a) massively sign content, which is (b)
	      long-lived, offer time and data to an attacker for comprising
	      cryptographic credentials. Signing large amount of data eases
	      common attacks that try to breach the key of the publisher. Based
	      on this observation, the following research challenges appear. To
	      which extent does the content publication model conflict with
	      cryptographic limitations? How can we achieve a transparent
	      re-signing without introducing additional cryptographical
	      weaknesses or key management overhead?

	      an intrinsic ICN security issue: possible mitigation approaches

	    ICN routing is a process that finds a data object based on its name 
	    initially provided by a requestor. ICN routing may
	    comprise three steps: a name resolution step, a discovery
	    step, and a delivery step. The name resolution step
	    translates the name of the requested data object into its
	    locator. The discovery step routes the request to data
	    object based on its name or locator. The last step
	    (delivery) routes the data object back to the
	    requestor. Depending on how these steps are combined, ICN
	    routing schemes can be categorized as: Route-By-Name
	    Routing (RBNR), Lookup-By-Name Routing (LBNR), and Hybrid
	    Routing (HR).

	  <section title="Route-By-Name Routing (RBNR)">
	    <t>
	      RBNR omits the first name resolution step. The name of
	      data object is directly used to route the request to the
	      data object. Therefore, routing information for each
	      data object has to be maintained in the routing
	      table. Since the number of data objects is very large
	      (estimated as 10^11 back in 2007 <xref target="DONA"/>
	      but this may be significantly larger than that, e.g.,
	      10^15 to 10^22), the size of routing tables becomes a
	      concern, as it can be proportional to the number of data
	      object unless an aggregation mechanism is introduced. On
	      the other hand, RBNR reduces overall latency and
	      simplifies the routing process due to the omission of
	      the resolution process. For the delivery step, RBNR
	      needs another identifier (ID) of either host or location
	      to forward the requested data object back to the
	      requestor. Otherwise, an additional routing mechanism
	      has to be introduced, such as bread-crumbs routing <xref
	      target="BREADCRUMBS"/>, in which each request leaves
	      behind a trail of breadcrumbs along its forwarding path,
	      and then the response is forwarded back to the requestor

	<section title="Mobility Management">
	  
	  <t>
	    Mobility management has been an active field in
	    host-centric communications for more than two decades. In
	    IETF in particular, starting with <xref target="RFC2002"
	    />, a multitude of enhancements to IP have been
	    standardized aiming to "allow transparent routing of IP
	    datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet" <xref
	    target="RFC5944" />. In a nutshell, mobility management
	    for IP networks is locator-oriented and relies on the
	    concept of a mobility anchor as a foundation for providing
	    always-on connectivity to mobile nodes. Other standards
	    organizations, such as 3GPP, have followed similar
	    anchor-based approaches. Traffic to and from the mobile
	    node must flow through the mobility anchor, typically
	    using a set of tunnels, enabling the mobile node to remain
	    reachable while changing its point of attachment to the
	    network.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    Needless to say, an IP network which supports node
	    mobility is more complex than one that does not, as
	    specialized network entities must be introduced in the
	    network architecture. This is reflected in the control
	    plane as well, which carries mobility-related signaling
	    messages, establishes and tears down tunnels and so
	    on. While mobile connectivity was an afterthought in IP,
	    in ICN this is considered a primary deployment
	    environment. Most, if not all, ICN proposals consider
	    mobility from the very beginning, although at varying
	    levels of architectural and protocol detail. That said, no
	    solution has so far come forward with a definite answer on
	    how to handle mobility in ICN using native primitives. In
	    fact, we observe that mobility appears to be addressed on
	    ICN proposal specific basis. That is, there is no single
	    paradigm solution, akin to tunneling through a mobility
	    anchor in host-centric networking, that can be applied
	    across different ICN proposals. For instance, although
	    widely-deployed mobile network architectures typically
	    come with their own network entities and associated
	    protocols, they follow the same line of design with
	    respect to managing mobility. This design thinking, which
	    calls for incorporating mobility anchors, permeates in the
	    ICN literature too.
	  </t>

	<t>
	  However, employing mobility anchors and tunneling is
	  probably not the best way forward in ICN research for mobile
	  networking. Fundamentally this approach is anything but
	  information-centric and location-indepedent. In addition, as
	  argued in <xref target="SEEN"/>, current mobility management
	  schemes anchor information retrieval not only at a specific
	  network gateway (e.g., home agent in Mobile IP) but due to
	  the end-to-end nature of host-centric communication also at
	  a specific correspondent node. However, once a change in the
	  point of attachment occurs, information retrieval from the
	  original "correspondent node" may be no longer optimal. This
	  was shown in <xref target="MANI"/>, for example, where a
	  simple mechanism that triggers the discovery of new
	  retrieval providers for the same data object, following a
	  change in the point of attachment, clearly outperforms a
	  tunnel-based approach like Mobile IP in terms of object
	  download times. The challenge here is how to capitalize on
	  location information while facilitating the use of ICN
	  primitives which natively support multicast and anycast.
	</t>

	<t>
	  ICN naming and name resolution, as well as the security
	  features that come along should natively support
	  mobility. For example, CCN <xref target="CCN"/> does not
	  have the restriction of spanning tree routing, so it is able
	  to take advantage of multiple interfaces or adapt to the
	  changes produced by rapid mobility (i.e., there is no need
	  to bind a layer 3 address with a layer 2 address). In fact,
	  client mobility can be simplified by allowing requests for
	  new content to normally flow from different interfaces, or
	  through newly connected points of attachment to the
	  network. However, when the node moving is the (only) content
	  source, it appears that more complex network support might
	  be necessary, including forwarding updates and cache
	  rebuilding. A case in point is a conversation network
	  service, such as a voice or video call between two
	  parties. The requirements in this case are more stringent
	  when support for seamless mobility is required, esp. when
	  compared to content dissemination that is amenable to
	  buffering. Another parameter that needs to be paid attention
	  to is the impact of using different wireless access
	  interfaces based on different technologies, where the
	  performance and link conditions can vary widely depending of
	  numerous factors.
	</t>
	  
	<t>
	  In host-centric networking, mobility management mechanisms
	  ensure optimal handovers and (ideally) seamless transition
	  from one point of attachment to another. In ICN, however,
	  the traditional meaning of "point of attachment" no longer
	  applies as communication is not restrained by location-based
	  access to data objects. Therefore, a "seamless transition"
	  in ICN ensures that content reception continues without any
	  perceptible change from the point of view of the ICN
	  application receiving that content. Moreover, this
	  transition needs to be executed in parallel with ICN content
	  identification and reaching mechanisms enabling scenarios,
	  such as, preparation of the content reaching process at the
	  target connectivity point, prior to the handover (to reduce
	  link switch disturbances). Finally, these mobility aspects
	  can also be tightly coupled with network management aspects,
	  in respect to policy enforcement, link control and other
	  parameters necessary for establishing the node's link to the
	  network.

      <section title="Wireless Networking">
	<t>
	  Today, all layer 2 wireless network radio access
	  technologies (L2) are developed with a clear assumption in
	  mind: the waist of the protocol stack is IP and it will be
	  so for the foreseeable future. By fixing the protocol stack
	  waist, engineers can answer a large set of questions,
	  including how to handle conversational traffic (e.g., voice
	  calls) vs. web access to online resources, how to support
	  multicast (the IP flavor), and so on, in a rather
	  straightforward manner. Broadcast, on the other hand, which
	  is inherent in wireless communication is not fully taken
	  advantage of. On the contrary, researchers are often more
	  concerned about introducing mechanisms that ensure that
	  "broadcast storms" do not take down a network. The question
	  of how broadcast can serve ICN needs better has yet to be
	  thoroughly investigated.
	</t>
	
	<t>
	  Wireless networking is often intertwined with mobility but
	  this is not always the case. In fact, empirical measurements
	  often indicate that many users tend to connect (and remain
	  connected) to a single Wi-Fi access point for considerable
	  amounts of time. A case in point, which is frequently cited
	  in different variations in the ICN literature, is access to
	  a document repository during a meeting. For instance, in a
	  typical IETF working group meeting, a scribe takes notes
	  which are uploaded to a centralized repository (see <xref
	  target="WNfig"/>). Subsequently, each meeting participant
	  obtains a copy of the document on their own devices for
	  local use, annotation, and sharing with colleagues that are
	  not present at the meeting. Note that in this example there
	  is no node mobility and that it is not important whether the
	  document with the notes is uploaded in one go at the end of
	  the session or in a streaming-like fashion as is typical
	  today with online (cloud-based) document processing.
	</t>

	<t>
	  In this scenario we observe that the same data object bits
	  (corresponding to the meeting notes) need to traverse the
	  wireless medium at least N+1 times, where N is the number of
	  meeting participants obtaining a copy of the notes. In
	  effect, a broadcast medium is shoehorned into N+1 virtual
	  unicast channels. One could argue that wireless local
	  connectivity is inexpensive, but this is not the critical
	  factor in this example. The actual information exchange
	  wastes N times the available network capacity, no matter
	  what is the spectral efficiency (or the economics)
	  underlying the wireless technology. This waste is a direct
	  result of extending the remote access paradigm from wired to
	  wireless communication, irrespective of the special
	  characteristics of the latter.
	</t>
	  
	  <t>
	    It goes without saying that an ICN approach that does not
	    take into consideration the wireless nature of an
	    interface will waste the same amount of resources as a
	    host-centric paradigm. In-network caching at the wireless
	    access point could reduce the amount of data carried over
	    the backhaul link but, if there is no change in the use of
	    the wireless medium, the NDO will still be carried over
	    the wireless ether N+1 times. Intelligent caching
	    strategies, replica placement cooperation and so on simply
	    cannot alleviate this. On the other hand, promiscuous
	    interface operation and opportunistic caching would
	    maximize wireless network capacity utilization in this
	    example.
	  </t>
	  
	  <t>
	    Arguably, if one designs a future wireless access
	    technology with an information-centric "layer 3" in mind,
	    many of the design choices that are obvious in an all-IP
	    architecture may no longer be valid. Although this is
	    clearly outside the scope of this document, a few research
	    challenges that the wider community may be interested in
	    include:

      <section title="Transport Services">
	<t>
	  ICN's receiver-driven communication model as described above
	  creates new options for transport protocol design, as it
	  does not rely solely on end-to-end communication from a
	  sender to a receiver. A requested object can be accessible
	  in multiple different network locations. A node can thus
	  decide how to utilize multiple sources, e.g., by sending
	  parallel requests for the same object or by switching
	  sources (or next hops) in a suitable schedule for a series
	  of requests.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In this model, the requestor would control the data rate by
	  regulating its request sending rate and next by performing
	  source/next-hop selections. Specific challenges depend on
	  the specific ICN approach, but general challenges for
	  receiver-driven transport protocols (or mechanisms, since
	  dedicated protocols might not be required) include flow and
	  congestion control, fairness, network utilization, stability
	  (of data rates under stable conditions) etc. <xref
	  target="HRICP"/> describes a sample request rate control
	  protocol and corresponding design challenges.
	</t>

<!--	
	<t><list style="hanging" hangIndent="6"> <t hangText="***KP
	Comment:"><vspace />Again receiver-driven transport is not new
	with ICN. HRICP is CCN-specific.</t></list></t>
-->	
	<t>
	  As mentioned above, the ICN communication paradigm does not
	  depend strictly on end-to-end flows, as contents might be
	  received from mid-network caches. The traditional concept of
	  a flow is then somewhat cancelled as sub-flows, or flowlets
	  might be formed on the fly, when fractions of an NDO are
	  transmitted from in-network caches. For a transport layer
	  protocol this is challenging, as any measurement related to
	  this flow, as traditionally done by transport protocols such
	  as TCP, will be hugely misleading. For example, false RTT
	  measurements will lead to largely variable average and
	  smooth RTT values, which in turn will trigger false timeout
	  expirations.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Furthermore, out-of-order delivery is expected to be common
	  in a scenario where parts of a content file are retrieved
	  from in-network caches, rather than from the origin
	  server. Several techniques for dealing with out-of-order
	  delivery have been proposed in the past for TCP, some of
	  which could potentially be modified and re-used in the
	  context of ICN.  Further research is needed on this
	  direction though to i) choose the right technique and ii)
	  adjust it according to the requirements of the ICN
	  architecture and transport protocol in use.
	</t>
	<t>
	  ICN offers routers the possibility to aggregate requests and
	  can use several paths, meaning that there is no such thing
	  as a (dedicated) end-to-end communication path, e.g., a
	  router that receives two requests for the same content at
	  the same time only sends one request to its neighbor. The
	  aggregation of requests has a general impact on transport
	  service design.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Achieving fairness for requestors can be one challenge as it
	  is not possible to identify the number of requestors behind
	  one particular request.  A second problem related to request
	  aggregation is the management of request retransmissions.
	  Generally, it is assumed that a router will not transmit a
	  request if it transmitted an identical request recently and
	  because there is no information about the requestor, the
	  router cannot distinguish the initial request from a client
	  from a retransmission from the same client.  In such a
	  situation, how routers can adapt their timers to use the
	  best of the communication paths.  Finally, aggregation of
	  requests has an impact on the server (producer) side. This
	  last has no way to determine the number of clients actually
	  consuming the content it is producing. This shift of model
	  influences the business model of the server, e.g., how to
	  implement pay-per-click.
	</t>
	<t>
	  NDOs can represent content used in different types of
	  applications with different QoS requirements, for example,
	  interactive real-time applications, media streaming, file
	  download. Each of these applications imposes different QoS
	  requirements on different elements in an information-centric
	  network, e.g., regarding cache placement, request-to-cache/source
	  routing. Achieving the necessary quality-of-service levels
	  in a shared network is an active ICN research topic.

      <section title="In-Network Caching">
	<t>
	  Explicitly named data objects allow for caching at
	  virtually any network element, including routers, proxy
	  caches and end-host machines. In-network caching can
	  therefore improve network performance by fetching content
	  from nodes geographically placed closer to the
	  end-user. Several issues that need further investigation
	  have been identified with respect to in-network
	  caching. Here we list some of the most important challenges
	  that relate to the properties of the new ubiquitous caching
	  system.
	</t>
	<section title="Cache Placement">
	  <t>
	    The declining cost of fast memory gives the opportunity to
	    deploy caches in network routers and take advantage of
	    explicitly named cached contents. There exist two
	    approaches to in-network caching, namely, on-path and
	    off-path caching. Both approaches have to consider the
	    issue of cache location. Off-path caching is similar to
	    traditional proxy-caching or CDN server
	    placement. Retrieval of contents from off-path caches
	    requires redirection of requests and, therefore, is
	    closely related to the Request-to-Cache Routing problem
	    discussed later. Off-path caches have to be placed in
	    strategic points within a network in order to reduce the
	    redirection delays and the number of detour hops to
	    retrieve cached contents. Previous research on
	    proxy-caching and CDN deployment is helpful in this case.
	  </t>

	  several places. If it affects everything why not summarize
	  it upfront?</t></list></t>
-->
	  <t>
	    On the other hand, on-path caching requires less network
	    intervention and fits more neatly in ICN. However, on-path
	    caching requires line-speed operation, which places more
	    constraints on the design and operation of in-network
	    caching elements. Furthermore, the gain of such a system
	    of on-path in-network caches relies on
	    opportunistic cache hits and has therefore been
	    considered of limited benefit, given the huge amount of
	    contents hosted in the Internet. For this reason, network
	    operators might initially consider only a limited number
	    of network elements to be upgraded to in-network caching
	    elements. The decision on which nodes should be equipped
	    with caches is an open issue and might be based, among
	    others, on topological criteria, or traffic
	    characteristics. These challenges relate to both the
	    Content Placement Problem and the Request-to-Cache Routing
	    Problem discussed below.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	  In call cases, however, the driver for the implementation, 
	  deployment and operation of in-network caches will be its cost. 
	  Operating caches at line speed inevitably requires faster 
	  memories, which increase the implementation cost. Based on the 
	  capital to be invested, ISPs will need to make strategic 
	  decisions on the cache placement, which can be driven by several
	  factors, such as: avoid inter-domain/expensive links, centrality
	  of nodes, size of domain and the corresponding spatial locality 
	  of users, traffic patterns in a specific part of the 
	  network (e.g., university vs. business vs. fashion district
	  of a city).

	<section title="Content Placement -- Content-to-Cache Distribution">
	  <t>
	    Given a number of (on-path or off-path) in-network caching
	    elements, content-to-cache distribution will affect both
	    the dynamics of the system, in terms of request
	    redirections (mainly in case of off-path caches) and the
	    gain of the system in terms of cache hits. A
	    straightforward approach to content placement is on-path
	    placement of contents as they travel from source to
	    destination. This approach reduces the computation and
	    communication overhead of placing content within the
	    network but, on the other hand, might reduce the chances
	    of hitting cached contents. This relates to the
	    Request-to-Cache Routing problem discussed next.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Furthermore, the number of replicas held in the system
	    brings up resource management issues in terms of cache
	    allocation. For example, continuously replicating data
	    objects in all network elements results in redundant
	    copies of the same objects. The issue of redundant
	    replication has been investigated in the past for
	    hierarchical web caches. However, in hierarchical
	    web-caching, overlay systems coordination between the data
	    and the control plane can guarantee increased performance
	    in terms of cache hits. Line-speed, on-path in-network
	    caching poses different requirements and therefore, new
	    techniques need to be investigated. In this direction,
	    there already exist some studies that attempt to reduce
	    redundancy of cached copies. However, the issue of
	    coordinated content placement in on-path caches still
	    remains open.

	  <t>
	    The Content-to-Cache Allocation problem relates also to
	    the characteristics of the content to be cached. Popular
	    content might need to be placed where it is going to be
	    requested next. Furthermore, issues of "expected content
	    popularity" or temporal locality need to be taken into
	    account in designing in-network caching algorithms in
	    order for some contents to be given priority (e.g.,
	    popular content vs. one-timers). The criteria as to which
	    contents should be given priority in in-network content
	    caches relate also to the business relationships between
	    content providers and network operators. Business model
	    issues will drive some of these decisions on
	    content-to-cache distribution, but such issues are outside
	    the scope of this note and are not discussed here further.

	<section title="Request-to-Cache Routing">
	  <t>
	    In order to take advantage of cached contents, requests
	    have to be forwarded to the nodes that temporarily host
	    (cache) the corresponding contents. This challenge relates
	    to name-based routing, discussed before. Requests should
	    ideally follow the path to the cached content. However,
	    instructions as to which content is cached where cannot be
	    broadcast throughout the network. Therefore, the knowledge
	    of a content's location at the time of the request might
	    either not exist, or it might not be accurate (i.e.,
	    contents might have been removed by the time a request is
	    redirected to a specific node).
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Coordination between the data and the control planes to
	    update information of cached contents has been considered,
	    but in this case scalability issues arise. We therefore,
	    have two options. We either have to rely on opportunistic
	    caching, where requests are forwarded to a server and in
	    case the content is found on the path, then the content is
	    fetched from this node (instead of the original server);
	    or we employ cache-aware routing techniques. Cache-aware
	    routing can either involve both the control and the data
	    plane, or only one of them. Furthermore, cache-aware
	    routing can be done in a domain-wide scale or can involve
	    more than one individual Autonomous System (AS). In the
	    latter case, business relationships between ASes might
	    need to be exploited in order to build a scalable model.

	<section title="Staleness Detection of Cached NDOs">
	  <t>
	    Due to the largely distributed copies of NDOs in
	    in-network caches, ICN should be able to provide a
	    staleness verification algorithm which provides
	    synchronization of NDOs located at their providers and
	    in-network caching points. Two types of approaches can be
	    considered for this problem, namely direct and indirect
	    approaches.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    In the direct approach, each cache looks up certain
	    information in the name of NDO, e.g., time stamp which
	    directly indicates its staleness. This approach is well
	    applicable to some NDOs that come from machine-to-machine
	    and Internet of Things scenarios, whose base operation
	    relies on obtaining the latest version of that NDO (i.e.,
	    a soil sensor in a farm providing different continuous
	    parameters that are sent to a display or green-house
	    regulation system) <xref target="freshness"/>.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    In the indirect approach, each cache consults the
	    publisher of the cached NDO about its staleness before
	    serving it. This approach assumes that the name of NDO
	    includes the publisher information which can be used to
	    reach to the publisher. It is suitable for the NDO whose
	    expiring time is difficult to be set in advance, e.g., a
	    webpage which contains main text (that stays the same ever
	    after) and the interactive section such as comments or ads
	    (that is updated irregularly).
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    It is often argued that ignoring stale NDOs in caches and
	    simply providing new names for updated NDOs might be
	    sufficient rather than using a staleness verification
	    algorithm to manage them. However, notifying the new names
	    of updated NDOs to users is not a trivial task. Unless the
	    update is informed to entire users at the same time, some
	    users would use the old acquainted name by intending to
	    retrieve the updated NDO.
	  </t>

	  <t>
	    One research challenge is how to design consistency and
	    coherence models for caching NDOs along with their
	    revision handling and updating protocols in a scalable
	    manner.

      <section title="Network Management">
	<t>
	  Managing networks has been a core craft in the IP-based
	  host-centric paradigm ever since the technology was
	  introduced in production networks. However, at the onset of
	  IP, management was considered primarily as an
	  add-on. Essential tools that are used daily by networkers,
	  such as ping and traceroute, did not become widely available
	  until more than a decade or so after IP was first
	  introduced. Management protocols, such as SNMP, also became
	  available much later than the original introduction of IP
	  and many still consider them insufficient despite the years
	  of experience we have running host-centric networks. Today,
	  when new networks are deployed network management is
	  considered a key aspect for any operator, a major challenge
	  which is directly reflected in higher OPEX if not done well.
	  If we want ICN to be deployed in infrastructure networks,
	  development of management tools and mechanisms must go
	  hand-in-hand with the rest of the architecture design.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Although defining an FCAPS model for ICN is clearly outside
	  the scope of this document, there is a need for creating
	  basic tools early on while ICN is still in the design and
	  experimentation phases that can evolve over time and help
	  network operations centers (NOC) to define policies,
	  validate that they are indeed used in practice, be notified
	  early on about failures, determine and resolve configuration
	  problems. AAA as well as performance management, from a NOC
	  perspective, will also need to be considered. Given the
	  expectations for a large number of nodes and unprecedented
	  traffic volumes, automating tasks, or even better employing
	  self-management mechanisms is preferred. The main challenge
	  here is that all tools we have at our disposal today are
	  node-centric, end-to-end oriented, or assuming a
	  packet-stream communication environment. Rethinking
	  reachability and operational availability, for example, can
	  yield significant insights into how information-centric
	  networks will be managed in the future.
	</t>
	<t>
	  With respect to network management we see three different
	  aspects. First, any operator needs to manage all resources
	  available in the network, which can range from node
	  connectivity to network bandwidth availability to in-network
	  storage to multi-access support. In ICN, users will also
	  bring into the network significant resources in terms of
	  network coverage extension, storage, and processing
	  capabilities. DTN characteristics should also be considered
	  to the degree that this is possible (e.g., content
	  dissemination through data mules).  Secondly, given
	  that nodes and links are not at the center of an
	  information-centric network, network management should
	  capitalize on native ICN mechanisms. For example, in-network
	  storage and name resolution can be used for monitoring,
	  while native publish/subscribe functionality can be used for
	  triggering notifications. Finally, management is also at the
	  core of network controlling capabilities by allowing operating
	  actions to be mediated and decided, triggering and activating
	  networking procedures in an optimized way. For example, monitoring
	  aspects can be conjugated with different management actions in a
	  coordinated way, allowing network operations to flow in a concertated
	  way. 
	</t>
	<t>
	  However, the considerations on leveraging intrinsic ICN
	  mechanisms and capabilities to support management operations
	  go beyond a simple mapping exercise. In fact, not only it
	  raises a series of challenges on its own, but also opens up
	  new possibilities for both ICN and "network management" as a
	  concept. For instance, naming mechanisms are central to ICN
	  intrinsic operations, which are used to identify and reach
	  content under different aspects (e.g., hierarchically
	  structured vs. 'flattish' names). In this way, ICN is
	  decoupled from host-centric aspects on which traditional
	  networking management schemes rely upon. As such, questions
	  are raised which can directly be translated into challenges
	  for network management capability, such as, for example how
	  to address a node or a network segment in a ICN naming
	  paradigm, how to identify which node is connected "where",
	  and if there is a host-centric protocol running from which
	  the management process can also leverage upon.
	</t>
	<t>
	  But, on the other hand, these same inherent ICN
	  characteristics also allow us to look into network
	  management through a new perspective. By centering its
	  operations around content, one can conceive new management
	  operations addressing, for example, per-content management
	  or access control, as well as analyzing performance per
	  content name instead of per link or node. Moreover, such
	  considerations can also be used to manage operational
	  aspects of ICN mechanisms themselves. For example, <xref
	  target="NDN-MGMT"/> re-utilizes inherent content-centric
	  capabilities of CCN to manage optimal link connectivity for
	  nodes, in concert with a network optimization
	  process. Conversely, how these content-centric aspects can
	  otherwise influence and impact management in other areas
	  (e.g., security, resilience) is also important, as
	  exemplified by in <xref target="ccn-access"/>, where access
	  control mechanisms are integrated into a prototype of the
	  <xref target="PURSUIT"/> architecture.
	</t>
	<t>
	  In this way, a set of core research challenges on ICN
	  management can be derived as:

	    <t>
	      Manage and control content reception at the destination
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Coordination of management information exchange and
	      control between ICN nodes and ICN network control points</t>
		<t>
	      Identification of management and controlling actions and
	      items through information naming
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Relationship between NDOs and host entities
	      identification (i.e., how to identify a particular link,
	      interface or flow that need to be managed)
