	This memo describes research challenges for
	Information-Centric Networking (ICN), an approach to evolve
	the Internet infrastructure to directly support information
	distribution by introducing uniquely named data as a core
	Internet principle. Data becomes independent from location,
	application, storage, and means of transportation, enabling or
	enhancing a number of desirable features, such as security,
	user-mobility, multicast and in-network caching. Mechanisms
	for realizing these benefits is subject of on-going research
	in the IRTF and elsewhere. This document describes current
	research challenges in ICN, including naming, security,
	routing, system scalability, mobility management, wireless

    <section title="Introduction">	
      <t>
	Information-centric networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve
	the Internet infrastructure to directly support this use by
	introducing named data as a network primitive. Data objects
	become independent of location, application, storage, and
	means of transportation, allowing for inexpensive and
	ubiquitous in-network caching and replication. The expected
	benefits are improved efficiency and security, better
	scalability with respect to information/bandwidth demand and
	better robustness in challenging communication scenarios.
      </t>

      <t>
	ICN concepts can be deployed by retooling the protocol stack:
	name-based data access can be implemented on top of the
	existing IP infrastructure, e.g., by allowing for named data
	structures, ubiquitous caching and corresponding transport
	services, or it can be seen as a packet-level internetworking
	technology that would cause fundamental changes to Internet
	routing and forwarding. In summary, ICN can evolve the
	Internet architecture towards a named-data-based network model
	with different properties and different services.
      </t>

      <t>
	This document presents the ICN research challenges that need
	to be addressed in order to achieve these goals. These
	research challenges are seen from a technical perspective,
	although business relationships between Internet players will
	also influence developments in this area.  We leave business
	challenges for a separate document, however. The objective of
	this memo is to document the technical challenges and
	corresponding current approaches and to expose requirements
	that should be addressed by future research work.
      </t>
	  
      <t>
	This document has been reviewed, commented, and discussed
	extensively for a period of nearly two years by the vast
	majority of ICNRG members, which certainly exceeds 100
	individuals. It is the consensus of ICNRG that the research
	challenges described in this document should be published in
	the IRTF Stream of the RFC series.  This document does not
	constitute a standard.

    <section title="Problems with Host-Centric Communications">
      <t>
	The best current practice to manage the above-mentioned growth
	in terms of data volume and number of devices is to increase
	infrastructure investment, employ application-layer overlays
	that cache content such as Content Distribution Networks
	(CDNs) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications, provide
	location-independent access to data, and optimize its
	delivery. In principle, such platforms provide a service model
	of accessing named data objects (NDOs) (e.g., replicated web
	resources in data centers) instead of a host-to-host packet
	delivery service model.
      </t>

      <t>
	However, since this functionality resides in overlays only,
	the full potential of content distribution platforms cannot be
	leveraged as the network is not aware of data requests and
	data transmissions. This has the following impact:
	<list style="symbols">
          <t>
	    data traffic typically follows sub-optimal paths as it is
	    effectively routed depending on the overlay topology
	    instead of the Internet layer topology;
	  </t>

          <t>
	    network capabilities, such as multicast and broadcast, are
	    largely underutilized or not employed at all. As a result,
	    request and delivery for the same object have to be made
	    multiple times;
	  </t>

          <t>
	    overlays typically require significant infrastructure
	    support, e.g., authentication portals, content storage,
	    and applications servers, making it often impossible to
	    establish local, direct communication;
	  </t>

          <t>
	    the forwarding layer cannot cooperate with transport layer
	    functions,so sometimes useful functionality such as local
	    retransmission, local rate control have to implemented
	    with TCP proxies or other intermediaries.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    provenance validation uses host authentication today. As such,
            even if there are locally cached copies available, it is normally
            not easily possible to validate their authenticity; and
	  </t>

          <t>
	    many applications follow their own approach to caching,
	    replication, transport, authenticity validation (if at
	    all), although they all share similar models for accessing
	    named data objects in the network.
	  </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
	Host-centric communication systems restrict applications to
	data transfer between end-hosts only. Naming data directly
	provides a powerful "hook" for applications to exploit and
	natively support multi-party communication, e.g.,
	multi-source/multi-destination communication and a ubiquitous
	information ecosystem that is not restricted to end-host
	addresses.

		actual creators/owners.</t>
            </list>
	  </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.concepts" title="Concepts">
        <t>Fundamentally, ICN provides access to named data as a
        first-order network service, i.e., the network is able to serve
        requests to named data natively. That means, network nodes can receive
        requests for named data and act as necessary, for example, by
        forwarding the request to a suitable next-hop. Consequently, the
        network processes requests for named data objects (and corresponding
        responses) natively. Every network node on a path is enabled to
        perform forwarding decisions, cache objects etc. This enables the
        network to forward such requests on optimal paths, employing the best
        transmission technologies at every node, e.g., broadcast/multicast
        transmission in wireless networks to avoid duplicate transmission of
        both requests and responses.</t>

        <t>In ICN there is a set of common concepts and node requirements
        beyond this basic service model. Naming data objects is a key concept.
        In general, ICN names represent neither network nodes nor interfaces
        -- they represent NDOs independently of their location. Names do play
        a key role in forwarding decisions and are used for matching requests
        to responses: In order to provide better support for accessing copies
        of NDOs regardless of their location, it is important to be able to
        validate that a response actually delivers the bits that correspond to
        an original request for named data.</t>

        <t>Name-content binding validation is a fundamental security service
        in ICN, and this is often achieved by establishing a verifiable
        binding between the object name and the actual object or an identity
        that has created the object. ICN can support other security services,
        such as provenance validation and encryption depending on the details
        of naming schemes, object models and assumptions on infrastructure
        support. Security services such as name-content binding validation are
        available to any node, i.e., not just the actual requestors. This is an
        important feature, for enabling ingress gateways to check object
        authenticity to prevent denial-of-service attacks.</t>

        <t>Based on these fundamental properties it is possible to leverage
        network storage ubiquitously: every ICN node can cache
        data objects and respond to requests for such objects -- it is not
        required to validate the authenticity of the node itself since
        name-content bindings can be validated. Ubiquitous in-network storage
        can be used for different purposes: it can enable sharing, i.e., the
        same object copy can be delivered to multiple users/nodes as in
        today's proxy caches and CDNs. It can also be used to make
        communication more robust (and perform better) by enabling the network
        to answer requests from local caches (instead of from origin servers).
        In case of disruption (message not delivered), a node can resend the
        request, and it could be answered by an on-path cache, i.e., on the
        other side of the disrupted link. The network itself would thus
        support retransmissions enabling shorter round-trip times and
        offloading origin servers and other parts of the network.</t>

<!--	
        <t>The request/response model and ubiquitous in-network storage also
        enable new options for implementing transport services, i.e., reliable
        transmission, flow control, etc. First of all, a request/response
        model can enable receiver-driven transport regimes, i.e., receivers
        (the requestors of NDOs) can control message sending rates by
        regulating the request sending rate (assuming that every response
        message has to be triggered by a request message). Retransmission
        would be achieved by resending requests, e.g., after a timeout.
        Because objects can be replicated, object transmission and transport
        sessions would not necessarily have end-to-end semantics: requests can
        be answered by caches, and a node can select one or multiple next-hop
        destinations for a particular request depending on configuration,
        observed performance or other criteria.</t>
-->
	<t>
	  ICN potentially retrieves segments of NDOs from multiple
	  data sources, and so only a requestor can determine the
	  completion of a retrieval process, i.e., the retrieval of
	  NDOs or individual segments is typically controlled by a
	  requestor. For this reason, ICN transport protocols are
	  typically based on a receiver-driven mechanism: requestors
	  can control message sending rates by regulating the request
	  sending rate (assuming that every response message has to be
	  triggered by a request message). Retransmission would be
	  achieved by resending requests, e.g., after a
	  timeout. Because objects can be replicated, object
	  transmission and transport sessions would not necessarily
	  have end-to-end semantics: requests can be answered by
	  caches, and a node can select one or multiple next-hop
	  destinations for a particular request depending on
	  configuration, observed performance or other criteria.
	</t>
	
        <t>
	  This receiver-driven communication model potentially enables
	  new interconnection and business models: a request for named
	  data can be linked to an interest of a requestor (or
	  requesting network) in data from another peer, which could
	  suggest modeling peering agreements and charging
	  accordingly.

    <section title="ICN Research Challenges">
      <section anchor="sec.naming" title="Naming, Data Integrity, and Data Orign Authentication">
        <t>Naming data objects is as important for ICN as naming hosts
        is for today's Internet. Fundamentally, ICN requires unique
        names for individual NDOs, since names are used for
        identifying objects independently of their location or
        container. In addition, since NDOs can be cached anywhere, the
        origin cannot be trusted anymore hence the importance to
        establish a verifiable binding between the object and its name
        (name-data binding validation) so that a requestor can be sure
        that the received bits do correspond to the NDO originally
        requested (data integrity). Data orign authentication is a
        different security service that can be related to naming,
        i.e., verifying that an NDO has indeed been published by a
        publisher (that could be identified by a name prefix).
	</t>

        <t>The above functions are fundamentally required for the
        information-centric network to work reliably, otherwise neither
        network elements nor requestors can trust object authenticity. Lack of
        this trust enables several attacks including DoS attacks by injecting
        spoofed content into the network. There are different ways to use
        names and cryptography to achieve the desired functions <xref
        target="ICNNAMING"></xref> <xref target="ICNSURVEY"></xref>, and there
        are different ways to manage namespaces correspondingly.</t>

        <t>Two types of naming schemes have been proposed in the ICN
        literature: hierarchical and flat namespaces. For example, a
        hierarchical scheme may have a structure similar to current URIs,
        where the hierarchy is rooted in a publisher prefix. Such hierarchy
        enables aggregation of routing information, improving scalability of
        the routing system. In some cases, names are human-readable, which
        makes it possible for users to manually type in names, reuse and, to
        some extent, map the name to user intent.</t>

        <t>
	  The second general class of naming schemes enables verifying
	  the object's name-data integrity without requiring a public
	  key infrastructure (PKI) or other third party to first
	  establish trust in the key. This is achieved, e.g., by
	  binding the hash of the NDO content to the object's
	  name. For instance, this can be done by directly embedding
	  the hash of the content in the name. Another option is an
	  indirect binding, which embeds the public key of the
	  publisher in the name and signs the hash of the content with
	  the corresponding private key. The resulting names are
	  typically non-hierarchical, or flat, although the publisher
	  field could be employed to create a structure which could
	  facilitate route aggregation.
	</t>
	<t>
	  There are several design trade-offs for ICN naming, which
	  affect routing and security.  Hash-based names are not human
	  readable nor hierarchical. They can however provide some
	  structure for aggregation, for instance, a name part
	  corresponding to a publisher. In hash-based names with
	  indirect binding, the key of the publisher is bound to the
	  name of NDO, and so when a user receives, e.g., the triplet
	  namely [data, key, signature], the receiving entity can
	  verify that the NDO has been generated by the possessor of
	  the private/public key pair and that the NDO has not been
	  changed in transit (data integrity). This can be done by
	  cryptographically hashing the received key and the name of
	  NDO, and comparing it with received hashed key. Then, the
	  key can be used to verify the signature.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Data origin authentication can be achieved by validating
	  public-key-cryptography-based signatures about an NDO's name
	  and content. In order to ascertain data integrity and origin
	  authenticity with such an approach, a PKI-like system is
	  required that would allow linking the corresponding public
	  key to a trust chain.
	</t>

        <t>Research challenges specific to naming include:
	<list style="symbols">
            <t>Naming static data objects can be performed by using content
            hashes as part of object names, so that publishers can calculate the
            hash over existing data objects and requestors and any ICN node
            can validate the name-content binding by re-calculating the hash
            and comparing it to the name (component). <xref
            target="RFC6920"></xref> specifies a concrete naming format for
            this.</t>

            <t>
	      Naming dynamic objects refers to use cases where the
	      name has to be generated before the object is
	      created. For example, this could be the case for live
	      streaming, when a publisher wants to make the stream
	      available by registering stream chunk names in the
	      network. One approach to this can be hash-based names
	      with indirect binding as described above.
	    </t>

            <t>Requestor privacy protection can be a challenge in ICN as a
            direct consequence of the accessing-named-data-objects paradigm:
            if the network can "see" requests and responses, it can also log
            request history for network segments or individual users, which
            can be undesirable, especially since names are typically expected
            to be long-lived. That is, even if the name itself does not reveal
            much information, the assumption is that the name can be used to
            retrieve the corresponding data objects in the future.</t>

            <t>Updating and versioning NDOs can be challenging because it can
            contradict fundamental ICN assumptions: if an NDO can be
            replicated and stored in in-network storage for later retrieval,
            names have to be long-lived and the name-content binding must
            not change: updating an object (i.e., changing the content without
            generating a new name) is not possible. Versioning is one possible
            solution, but requires a naming scheme that supports it (and a way
            for requestors to learn about versions).</t>

            <t>Managing accessibility: whereas in ICN the general assumption
            is to enable ubiquitous access to NDOs, there can be relevant use
            cases where access to objects should be restricted, for example to
            a specific user group. There are different approaches for this,
            such as object encryption (requiring key distribution and related
            mechanisms) or the concept of scopes, e.g., based on names that
            can only be used/resolved under some constraints.</t>

	<t>
	  Security is an active research field in ICN. This section
	  provides an overview of important important security
	  features and corresponding challenges that are related to
	  shifting to information-centric communications. Some
	  challenges are well-understood, and there are (sometimes
	  multiple different) approaches to address them, whereas
	  other challenges are active research and engineering topics.
	</t>

        <section title="Data Integrity and Orign Authentication">
          <t>As mentioned in section <xref
          target="sec.naming"></xref>, data integrity verification is
          an important ICN feature, since NDOs are retrieved not only
          from an original copy holder but also from any caching
          point. Hence, the communication channel endpoints to
          retrieve NDOs are not trustable anymore and solutions widely
          used today such as TLS <xref target="RFC5246"></xref> cannot
          be used as a general solution. Since data objects can be
          maliciously modified, ICN should provide receivers with a
          security mechanism to verify the integrity of the data
          object, and there are different ways to achieve this.</t>

          <t>An efficient approach for static NDOs is providing a
          name-content-binding by hashing an NDO and using the hash as a part
          of the object's name. <xref target="RFC6920"></xref> provides a
          mechanism and a format for representing a digest algorithm and the
          actual digest in a name (amongst other information).</t>

          <t>For dynamic objects where it is desirable to refer to an NDO by
          name before the object has been created, public-key cryptography is
          often applied, i.e., every NDO would be authenticated by means of a
          signature performed by the data object publisher so that any data
          object consumer can verify the validity of the data object based on
          the signature. However, in order to verify the signature of an
          object, the consumer must know the public key of the entity that
          signed the object.</t>

	  <t>
	    Data Orign Authentication, i.e., verifying that an NDO has
	    indeed been published by a publisher, requires a secure
	    binding of an NDO name to a publisher identiy -- this is
	    also typically implemented using public key cryptography,
	    i.e., by requiring a recevier to verify digital signatures
	    that as part of a received message.
	  </t>
	  
          <t>One research challenge is then to support a mechanism to
          distribute the publisher's public keys to the consumers of
          data objects. There are two main approaches to achieve this;
          one is based on an external third party authority such as
          hierarchical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) (see <xref
          target="RFC5280"></xref> for a description of hierarchical
          PKI) and the other is to adapt a hash-based scheme with
          indirect binding. The former, as the name implies, depends
          on an external third party authority to distribute the
          public key of the publisher for the consumers. In a
          hash-based scheme with indirect binding, the public key (or
          a hash of it) would be used as part of the name -- which is
          sufficient to validate the data integrity.</t>

          <t>In cases where information about the origin of a data object is
          not available by other means, the object itself would have to
          incorporate the necessary information to determine the object
          publisher, for example with a certificate, that can be validated
          through the PKI. Once the certificate is authenticated, its public
          key can be used to authenticate the signed data object itself.</t>
	</section>

        <section title="Binding NDOs to Real-World Identities">
          <t>In addition to validating NDO authenticity, it is still important
          to bind real-world identities, e.g., a publisher identity, to
          objects, so that a requestor can verify that a received object was
          actually published by a certain source.</t>

          <t>With hash-based names, real world identity bindings are
          not intrinsically established: the name provides the hash of
          the NDO or of the public key that has been used to sign the
          NDO. There needs to be another binding to a real world
          identity if that feature is requested.</t>

          <t>If the object name directly provides the publisher name and if
          that name is protected by a certificate that links to a PKI-like trust
          chain, the object name itself can provide an intrinsic binding to a
          real world identity.</t>

          <t>Binding between NDOs and real world identities is essential but
          there is no universal way to achieve it as it is all intrinsic to a
          particular ICN approach.</t>
        </section>

	<section title="Access Control and Authorization">
	  <t>
	    Access control and authorization is a challenge in ICN,
	    because of the lack of user-to-server authentication in
	    the fundamental named-data-based communication model.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    All ICN entities are capable of delivering NDOs on demand
	    due to their in-network caching function. In such an
	    environment, traditional access control schemes based on
	    Access Control List (ACL) are ill-suited since widely
	    distributed ICN entities have to maintain an identical
	    control policy over NDOs for each consumer, which is
	    prohibited due to computational overhead and privacy
	    issues. There are two complementary approaches to address
	    the issues:
	    <list style="numbers">
	      <t>
		Separated approach: access control service from a
		third party that is independent from ICN entities.
		Due to the clear separation, ICN entities free from
		computational overhead to determine the accessibility
		of NDOs by consumers and also consumers can secure
		their privacy through the independent authorization
		entity <xref target="access-control-delegation"/>.
		Relevant challenges to this approach include reducing
		the authorization delay (when communicating to the
		access control provider) and currency and consistency
		of access control information (when access control
		lists are distributed).
	      </t>
	      <t>
		Integrated approach: access control service from ICN
		entities. This mechanism is often based on content
		encryption and key distribution <xref
		target="encryption-ac"/>. As mentioned previously,
		this approach suffers from prohibitive overhead for
		ICN entities due to the process of key
		verification. While key distribution is per se
		challenging, this approach is beneficial in a way that
		NDOs can be retrieved without the help of an external
		access control provider. Challenges to this approach
		include:
		<list style="numbers">
		  <t>
		    applying an access control mechanism for dynamic
		    NDOs in in-network caches in a timely manner;
		  </t>
		  <t>
		    providing consumers with the different levels of

	<section title="Encryption">
	  <t>
	    In ICN, NDOs can be encrypted to implement access control
	    (only consumers in possession of corresponding decryption
	    keys can access the content) or privacy (same
	    approach). Distributing and managing the corresponding
	    keys as well as providing usable interfaces to
	    applications and human users is a challenge and subject of
	    on-going work.

        <section title="Traffic Aggregation and Filtering">
          <t>One request message to retrieve a data object can actually
          aggregate requests coming from several consumers. This aggregation
          of requests reduces the overall traffic but makes per-requestor
          filtering harder. The challenge in this case is to provide a
          mechanism that allows request aggregation and per-requestor
          filtering. A possible solution is to indicate the set of requestors
          in the aggregated request such that the response can indicate the
          subset of requestors allowed to access the data object. However,
          this solution requires collaboration from other nodes in the network
          and is not suitable for caching. Another possible solution is to
          encrypt data objects and ensure that only authorised consumers can
          decrypt them. This solution does not preclude caching and does not
          require collaboration from the network. However, it implies a
          mechanism to generate group keys (e.g., different private keys can
          be used to decrypt the same encrypted data object) <xref

        <section title="State Overloading">

          <t>ICN solutions that implement state on intermediate routers for
          request routing or forwarding (e.g., CCN <xref target="CCN"></xref>)
          are subject to denial of service attacks from overloading or
          superseding the internal state of a router (e.g., 'interest
          flooding' <xref target="BACKSCATTER"></xref>). Additionally,
          stateful forwarding can enable attack vectors such as resource
          exhaustion or complexity attacks to the routing infrastructure. The
          challenge is then to provision routers and construct internal state
          in a way that alleviates sensibility to such attacks. The problem
          becomes even harder, if the protocol does not provide information
          about the origin of messages. Without origin, it is a particular
          challenge to distinguish between regular (intense) use and misuse of
          the infrastructure.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Delivering Data Objects from Replicas">

		<t>A common capability of ICN solutions is data replication and
          in-network storage. Delivering replicated data objects from caches
          decouples content consumption from data sources, which leads to a
          loss of control on (1) content access, and (2) content
          dissemination. In a widely distributed, decentralized environment
          like the Internet, this raises several challenges.</t>

          <t>One group of challenges is related to content management. Without
          access control, a content provider loses the means to count and
          survey content consumption, to limit access scopes, to control or
          know about the number of copies of its data in the network, or to
          withdraw earlier publications reliably. Any non-cooperative or desynchronized
          data cache may hinder an effective content management policy.</t>

          <t>Another group of challenges arises from potential traffic
          amplifications in the decoupled environment. ICN solutions that
          attempt to retrieve content from several replicas in parallel, or
          decorrelated network routing states, but also distributed attackers
          may simultaneously initiate the transmission of content from
          multiple replicas towards the same destination (e.g., 'initiated
          overloads' or 'blockades' <xref target="BACKSCATTER"></xref>).
          Methods for mitigating such threats need rigorous forwarding checks
          that require alignment with caching procedures (e.g., on-path or
          off-path).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Cryptographic Robustness">
          <t>Content producers sign their content to ensure the integrity of
          data and to allow for data object authentication. This is a
          fundamental requirement in ICN due to distributed caching.
          Publishers, who (a) massively sign content, which is (b) long-lived,
          offer time and data to an attacker for comprising cryptographic
          credentials. Signing large amount of data eases common attacks that
          try to breach the key of the publisher. Based on this observation,
          the following research challenges emerge:

        <section title="Routing and Forwarding Information Bases">

          attacking routing scalability in networks that rely on routing by
          name. This is an intrinsic ICN security issue: possible mitigation
          approaches include combining routing information authenticity
          validation with filtering (e.g., maximum de-aggregation level

               title="Routing and Resolution System Scalability">
        <t>ICN routing is a process that finds a NDO based on its name
        initially provided by a requestor. ICN routing may comprise three
        steps: (i) name resolution, (ii) discovery, and (iii) delivery.
        The name resolution step translates the name of the requested NDO
        into its locator. The discovery step routes the request to data
        object based on its name or locator. The last step (delivery) routes
        the data object back to the requestor. Depending on how these steps
        are combined, ICN routing schemes can be categorized as Route-By-Name
        Routing (RBNR), Lookup-By-Name Routing (LBNR), and Hybrid Routing
        (HR) as discussed in the following subsections.</t>

        <section title="Route-By-Name Routing">
          <t>RBNR omits the first name resolution step as the name of the NDO
          is directly used to route the request to the data object.
          Therefore, routing information for each data object has to be
          maintained in the routing table. Since the number of data objects is
          very large (estimated as 10^11 back in 2007 <xref
          target="DONA"></xref> but this may be significantly larger than
          that, e.g., 10^15 to 10^22), the size of routing tables becomes a
          concern, as it can be proportional to the number of data objects
          unless an aggregation mechanism is introduced. On the other hand,
          RBNR reduces overall latency and simplifies the routing process due
          to the omission of the resolution process. For the delivery step,
          RBNR needs another identifier (ID) of either host or location to
          forward the requested data object back to the requestor. Otherwise,
          an additional routing mechanism has to be introduced, such as
          bread-crumbs routing <xref target="BREADCRUMBS"></xref>, in which
          each request leaves behind a trail of breadcrumbs along its
          forwarding path, and then the response is forwarded back to the
          requestor consuming the trail.</t>
		  
		  <t>Challenges specific to RBNR include:
		      <list style="symbols">
              <t>How can we aggregate the names of data objects to reduce the
              number of routing entries?</t>

              <t>How does a user learn the name which is designed for
              aggregation by provider? For example, although we name our
              contribution as "ICN research challenges", the IRTF (provider) may
              want to change the name to "/IETF/IRTF/ICN/Research challenges"
              for aggregation. In this case, how does a user learn the name
              "/IETF/IRTF/ICN/Research challenges" to retrieve the contribution
              initially named "ICN research challenges" without any resolution
              process?</t>

              <t>Without introducing the name aggregation scheme, can we still
              achieve scalable routing by taking advantage of topological
              structure and distributed copies? For example, would employing compact
              routing <xref target="COMPACT"></xref>, random walk <xref
              target="RANDOM"></xref> or greedy routing <xref
              target="GREEDY"></xref> work at Internet scale?</t>

              <t>How can we incorporate copies of a data object in in-network
              caches in this routing scheme?</t>

	      <t>
		Bread-crumbs routing implies a symmetric path for ICN
		request and response delivery. Some network
		configurations and link types prohibit symmetric path
		forwarding, so it would be challenging to interconnect
		such networks to bread-crumbs routing-based
		infrastructure. For example, certain forwarding
		strategies in Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) <xref
		target="RFC4838"/> are employing opportunistic
		forwarding where responses cannot be assumed to travel
		the same path as requests.

          be used as locators, the discovery step can depend on the current IP
          infrastructure. The delivery step can be implemented similarly to IP
          routing. The locator of the requestor is included in the request

      <section title="Mobility Management">
        <t>Mobility management has been an active field in host-centric
        communications for more than two decades. In IETF in particular,
        starting with <xref target="RFC2002"></xref>, a multitude of
        enhancements to IP have been standardized aiming to "allow transparent
        routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes in the Internet" <xref
        target="RFC5944"></xref>. In a nutshell <xref target="MMIN" />, mobility management for IP
        networks is locator-oriented and relies on the concept of a mobility
        anchor as a foundation for providing always-on connectivity to mobile
        nodes. Other standards organizations, such as 3GPP, have followed
        similar anchor-based approaches. Traffic to and from the mobile node
        must flow through the mobility anchor, typically using a set of
        tunnels, enabling the mobile node to remain reachable while changing
        its point of attachment to the network.</t>

        <t>Needless to say, an IP network which supports node mobility is more
        complex than one that does not, as specialized network entities must
        be introduced in the network architecture. This is reflected in the
        control plane as well, which carries mobility-related signaling
        messages, establishes and tears down tunnels and so on. While mobile
        connectivity was an afterthought in IP, in ICN this is considered a
        primary deployment environment. Most, if not all, ICN proposals
        consider mobility from the very beginning, although at varying levels
        of architectural and protocol detail. That said, no solution has so
        far come forward with a definite answer on how to handle mobility in
        ICN using native primitives. In fact, we observe that mobility appears
        to be addressed on an ICN proposal-specific basis. That is, there is no
        single paradigm solution, akin to tunneling through a mobility anchor
        in host-centric networking, that can be applied across different ICN
        proposals. For instance, although widely-deployed mobile network
        architectures typically come with their own network entities and
        associated protocols, they follow the same line of design with respect
        to managing mobility. This design thinking, which calls for
        incorporating mobility anchors, permeates in the ICN literature
        too.</t>

        <t>However, employing mobility anchors and tunneling is probably not
        the best way forward in ICN research for mobile networking.
        Fundamentally this approach is anything but information-centric and
        location-independent. In addition, as argued in <xref
        target="SEEN"></xref>, current mobility management schemes anchor
        information retrieval not only at a specific network gateway (e.g.,
        home agent in Mobile IP) but due to the end-to-end nature of
        host-centric communication also at a specific correspondent node.
        However, once a change in the point of attachment occurs, information
        retrieval from the original "correspondent node" may be no longer
        optimal. This was shown in <xref target="MANI"></xref>, for example,
        where a simple mechanism that triggers the discovery of new retrieval
        providers for the same data object, following a change in the point of
        attachment, clearly outperforms a tunnel-based approach like Mobile IP
        in terms of object download times. The challenge here is how to
        capitalize on location information while facilitating the use of ICN
        primitives which natively support multicast and anycast.</t>

        <t>ICN naming and name resolution, as well as the security features
        that come along should natively support mobility. For example, CCN
        <xref target="CCN"></xref> does not have the restriction of spanning
        tree routing, so it is able to take advantage of multiple interfaces
        or adapt to the changes produced by rapid mobility (i.e., there is no
        need to bind a layer 3 address with a layer 2 address). In fact,
        client mobility can be simplified by allowing requests for new content
        to normally flow from different interfaces, or through newly connected
        points of attachment to the network. However, when the node moving is
        the (only) content source, it appears that more complex network
        support might be necessary, including forwarding updates and cache
        rebuilding. A case in point is a conversation network service, such as
        a voice or video call between two parties. The requirements in this
        case are more stringent when support for seamless mobility is
        required, especially when compared to content dissemination that is amenable
        to buffering. Another parameter that needs to be paid attention to is
        the impact of using different wireless access interfaces based on
        different technologies, where the performance and link conditions can
        vary widely depending of numerous factors.</t>

        <t>In host-centric networking, mobility management mechanisms ensure
        optimal handovers and (ideally) seamless transition from one point of
        attachment to another. In ICN, however, the traditional meaning of
        "point of attachment" no longer applies as communication is not
        restrained by location-based access to data objects. Therefore, a
        "seamless transition" in ICN ensures that content reception continues
        without any perceptible change from the point of view of the ICN
        application receiving that content. Moreover, this transition needs to
        be executed in parallel with ICN content identification and delivery
        mechanisms enabling scenarios, such as, preparation of the content
        delivery process at the target connectivity point, prior to the
        handover (to reduce link switch disturbances). Finally, these mobility
        aspects can also be tightly coupled with network management aspects,
        in respect to policy enforcement, link control and other parameters
        necessary for establishing the node's link to the network.</t>

        <t>In summary, the following research challenges on ICN mobility
        management can be derived: <list style="symbols">
            <t>How can mobility management take full advantage of native ICN
            primitives?</t>

            <t>How do we avoid the need for mobility anchors in a network that
            by design supports multicast, anycast and location-indepedent
            information retrieval?</t>

            <t>How can content retrieval mechanisms interface with specific
            link operations, such as identifying which links are available for
            certain content?</t>

            <t>How can mobility be offered as a service, which is only
            activated when the specific user/content/conditions require
            it?</t>

            <t>How can mobility management be coordinated between the node and
            the network for optimization and policing procedures?</t>

            <t>How do we ensure that managing mobility does not introduce
            scalability issues in ICN?</t>

            <t>How will the name resolution process be affected by rapid
            topological changes, when the content source itself is mobile?</t>

      <section title="Wireless Networking">
        <t>Today, all layer 2 (L2) wireless network radio access technologies
        are developed with a clear assumption in mind: the waist of the
        protocol stack is IP and it will be so for the foreseeable future. By
        fixing the protocol stack waist, engineers can answer a large set of
        questions, including how to handle conversational traffic (e.g., voice
        calls) vs. web traffic, how to support multicast, and so on, in a rather straightforward manner.
        Broadcast, on the other hand, which is inherent in wireless
        communication is not fully taken advantage of. On the contrary,
        researchers are often more concerned about introducing mechanisms that
        ensure that "broadcast storms" do not take down a network. The
        question of how can broadcast better serve ICN needs has yet to be
        thoroughly investigated.</t>

        <t>Wireless networking is often intertwined with mobility but this is
        not always the case. In fact, empirical measurements often indicate
        that many users tend to connect (and remain connected) to a single
        Wi-Fi access point for considerable amounts of time. A case in point,
        which is frequently cited in different variations in the ICN
        literature, is access to a document repository during a meeting. For
        instance, in a typical IETF working group meeting, a scribe takes
        notes which are uploaded to a centralized repository (see <xref
        target="WNfig"></xref>). Subsequently, each meeting participant
        obtains a copy of the document on their own devices for local use,
        annotation, and sharing with colleagues that are not present at the
        meeting. Note that in this example there is no node mobility and that
        it is not important whether the document with the notes is uploaded in
        one go at the end of the session or in a streaming-like fashion as is
        typical today with online (cloud-based) document processing.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>In this scenario we observe that the same data object bits
        (corresponding to the meeting notes) need to traverse the wireless
        medium at least N+1 times, where N is the number of meeting
        participants obtaining a copy of the notes. In effect, a broadcast
        medium is shoehorned into N+1 virtual unicast channels. One could
        argue that wireless local connectivity is inexpensive, but this is not
        the critical factor in this example. The actual information exchange
        wastes N times the available network capacity, no matter what is the
        spectral efficiency (or the economics) underlying the wireless
        technology. This waste is a direct result of extending the remote
        access paradigm from wired to wireless communication, irrespective of
        the special characteristics of the latter.</t>

        <t>It goes without saying that an ICN approach that does not take into
        consideration the wireless nature of an interface will waste the same
        amount of resources as a host-centric paradigm. In-network caching at
        the wireless access point could reduce the amount of data carried over
        the backhaul link but, if there is no change in the use of the
        wireless medium, the NDO will still be carried over the wireless ether
        N+1 times. Intelligent caching strategies, replica placement
        cooperation and so on simply cannot alleviate this. On the other hand,
        promiscuous interface operation and opportunistic caching would
        maximize wireless network capacity utilization in this example.</t>

        <t>Arguably, if one designs a future wireless access technology with
        an information-centric "layer 3" in mind, many of the design choices
        that are obvious in an all-IP architecture may no longer be valid.
        Although this is clearly outside the scope of this document, a few
        research challenges that the wider community may be interested in
        include: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Can we use wireless resources more frugally with the

      <section title="Rate and Congestion Control">
        <t>
	  ICN's receiver-driven communication model as described above
	  creates new opportunities for transport protocol design, as
	  it does not rely solely on end-to-end communication from a
	  sender to a requestor. A requested data object can be
	  accessible in multiple different network locations. A node
	  can thus decide how to utilize multiple sources, e.g., by
	  sending parallel requests for the same NDO or by switching
	  sources (or next hops) in a suitable schedule for a series
	  of requests.
	</t>

        <t>
	  In this model, the requestor would control the data rate by
	  regulating its request sending rate and next by performing
	  source/next-hop selections. Specific challenges depend on
	  the specific ICN approach, but general challenges for
	  receiver-driven transport protocols (or mechanisms, since
	  dedicated protocols might not be required) include flow and
	  congestion control, fairness, network utilization, stability
	  (of data rates under stable conditions) etc.  <xref
	  target="HRICP"></xref> and <xref target="ConTug"></xref>
	  describe request rate control protocols and corresponding
	  design challenges.
	</t>

	
        <t>
	  As mentioned above, the ICN communication paradigm does not
	  depend strictly on end-to-end flows, as contents might be
	  received from in-network caches. The traditional concept of
	  a flow is then somewhat not valid as sub-flows, or flowlets,
	  might be formed on the fly, when fractions of an NDO are
	  transmitted from in-network caches. For a transport layer
	  protocol this is challenging, as any measurement related to
	  this flow as traditionally done by transport protocols such
	  as TCP, can often prove misleading. For example, false
	  Round-Trip Time (RTT) measurements will lead to largely
	  variable average and smoothed RTT values, which in turn will
	  trigger false timeout expirations.
	</t>

        <t>
	  Furthermore, out-of-order delivery is expected to be common
	  in a scenario where parts of a data object are retrieved
	  from in-network caches, rather than from the origin
	  server. Several techniques for dealing with out-of-order
	  delivery have been proposed in the past for TCP, some of
	  which could potentially be modified and re-used in the
	  context of ICN. Further research is needed in this direction
	  though to choose the right technique and adjust it according
	  to the requirements of the ICN architecture and transport
	  protocol in use.
	</t>

        <t>
	  ICN offers routers the possibility to aggregate requests and
	  can use several paths, meaning that there is no such thing
	  as a (dedicated) end-to-end communication path, e.g., a
	  router that receives two requests for the same content at
	  the same time only sends one request to its neighbour. The
	  aggregation of requests has a general impact on transport
	  protocol design and offers new options for employing
	  per-node forwarding strategies and for rethinking in-network
	  resource sharing. <xref target="hotnets2014-psaras"/>
	</t>

        <t>
	  Achieving fairness for requestors can be one challenge as it
	  is not possible to identify the number of requestors behind
	  one particular request. A second problem related to request
	  aggregation is the management of request
	  retransmissions. Generally, it is assumed that a router will
	  not transmit a request if it transmitted an identical
	  request recently and because there is no information about
	  the requestor, the router cannot distinguish the initial
	  request from a client from a retransmission from the same
	  client. In such a situation, how routers can adapt their
	  timers to use the best of the communication paths.
	</t>

      <section title="In-Network Caching">
        <t>
	  Explicitly named data objects allow for caching at virtually
	  any network element, including routers, proxy caches and
	  end-user devices. In-network caching can therefore improve
	  network performance by fetching content from nodes
	  geographically placed closer to the end-user. Several issues
	  that need further investigation have been identified with
	  respect to in-network caching. In this section we list
	  important challenges that relate to the properties of the
	  new ubiquitous caching system.
	</t>

        <section title="Cache Placement">
          <t>
	    The declining cost of fast memory gives the opportunity to
	    deploy caches in network routers and take advantage of
	    cached NDOs. We identify two approaches to in-network
	    caching, namely, on-path and off-path caching. Both
	    approaches have to consider the issue of cache
	    location. Off-path caching is similar to traditional
	    proxy-caching or CDN server placement. Retrieval of
	    contents from off-path caches requires redirection of
	    requests and, therefore, is closely related to the
	    Request-to-Cache Routing problem discussed later. Off-path
	    caches have to be placed in strategic points within a
	    network in order to reduce the redirection delays and the
	    number of detour hops to retrieve cached contents.
	    Previous research on proxy-caching and CDN deployment is
	    helpful in this case.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    On the other hand, on-path caching requires less network
	    intervention and fits more neatly in ICN. However, on-path
	    caching requires line-speed operation, which places more
	    constraints on the design and operation of in-network
	    caching elements. Furthermore, the gain of such a system
	    of on-path in-network caches relies on opportunistic cache
	    hits and has therefore been considered of limited benefit,
	    given the huge amount of contents hosted in the
	    Internet. For this reason, network operators might
	    initially consider only a limited number of network
	    elements to be upgraded to in-network caching
	    elements. The decision on which nodes should be equipped
	    with caches is an open issue and might be based, among
	    others, on topological criteria, or traffic
	    characteristics. These challenges relate to both the
	    Content Placement Problem and the Request-to-Cache Routing
	    Problem discussed below.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    In most cases, however, the driver for the implementation,
	    deployment and operation of in-network caches will be its
	    cost.  Operating caches at line speed inevitably requires
	    faster memory, which increases the implementation
	    cost. Based on the capital to be invested, ISPs will need
	    to make strategic decisions on the cache placement, which
	    can be driven by several factors, such as: avoid
	    inter-domain/expensive links, centrality of nodes, size of
	    domain and the corresponding spatial locality of users,
	    traffic patterns in a specific part of the network (e.g.,
	    university vs. business vs.  fashion district of a
	    city).
	  </t>
	</section>

        <section title="Content Placement -- Content-to-Cache Distribution">
          <t>Given a number of on-path or off-path in-network caching
          elements, content-to-cache distribution will affect both the
          dynamics of the system, in terms of request redirections (mainly in
          case of off-path caches) and the gain of the system in terms of
          cache hits. A straightforward approach to content placement is
          on-path placement of contents as they travel from source to
          destination. This approach reduces the computation and communication
          overhead of placing content within the network but, on the other
          hand, might reduce the chances of hitting cached contents. This
          relates to the Request-to-Cache Routing problem discussed next.</t>

          <t>Furthermore, the number of replicas held in the system brings up
          resource management issues in terms of cache allocation. For
          example, continuously replicating data objects in all network
          elements results in redundant copies of the same objects. The issue
          of redundant replication has been investigated in the past for
          hierarchical web caches. However, in hierarchical web-caching,
          overlay systems coordination between the data and the control plane
          can guarantee increased performance in terms of cache hits.
          Line-speed, on-path in-network caching poses different requirements
          and therefore, new techniques need to be investigated. In this
          direction, reducing the redundancy of cached copies is a study item. However, the issue of coordinated
          content placement in on-path caches remains open.</t>

          <t>The Content-to-Cache Allocation problem relates also to the
          characteristics of the content to be cached. Popular content might
          need to be placed where it is going to be requested next.
          Furthermore, issues of "expected content popularity" or temporal
          locality need to be taken into account in designing in-network
          caching algorithms in order for some contents to be given priority
          (e.g., popular content vs. one-timers). The criteria as to which
          contents should be given priority in in-network content caches
          relate also to the business relationships between content providers
          and network operators. Business model issues will drive some of
          these decisions on content-to-cache distribution, but such issues
          are outside the scope of this note and are not discussed here
          further.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Request-to-Cache Routing">
          <t>In order to take advantage of cached contents, requests have to
          be forwarded to the nodes that cache the
          corresponding contents. This challenge relates to name-based
          routing, discussed earlier. Requests should ideally follow the path
          to the cached NDO. However, instructions as to which content is
          cached where cannot be broadcast throughout the network. Therefore,
          the knowledge of a NDO location at the time of the request
          might either not exist, or it might not be accurate (i.e., contents
          might have been removed by the time a request is redirected to a
          specific node).</t>

          <t>Coordination between the data and the control planes to update
          information of cached contents has been considered, but in this case
          scalability issues arise. We therefore, have two options. We either
          have to rely on opportunistic caching, where requests are forwarded
          to a server and in case the NDOt is found on the path, then the
          content is fetched from this node instead of the origin server;
          or we employ cache-aware routing techniques. Cache-aware routing can
          either involve both the control and the data plane, or only one of
          them. Furthermore, cache-aware routing can be done in a domain-wide
          scale or can involve more than one individual Autonomous System
          (AS). In the latter case, business relationships between ASes might
          need to be exploited in order to build a scalable model.</t>

        <section title="Staleness Detection of Cached NDOs">
          <t>Due to the largely distributed copies of NDOs in in-network
          caches, ICN should be able to provide a staleness verification
          algorithm which provides synchronization of NDOs located at their
          providers and in-network caching points. Two types of approaches can
          be considered for this problem, namely direct and indirect
          approaches.</t>

          <t>In the direct approach, each cache looks up certain information
          in the name of NDO, e.g., timestamp which directly indicates its
          staleness. This approach is applicable to some NDOs that come
          from machine-to-machine and Internet of Things scenarios, whose base
          operation relies on obtaining the latest version of that NDO (i.e.,
          a soil sensor in a farm providing different continuous parameters
          that are sent to a display or green-house regulation system) <xref
          target="FRESHNESS"></xref>.</t>

          <t>In the indirect approach, each cache consults the publisher of
          the cached NDO about its staleness before serving it. This approach
          assumes that the NDO includes the publisher information
          which can be used to reach the publisher. It is suitable for the
          NDO whose expiration time is difficult to be set in advance, e.g., a
          web page which contains main text (that stays the same ever after)
          and the interactive sections such as comments or ads (that are updated
          irregularly).</t>

          <t>It is often argued that ignoring stale NDOs in caches and simply
          providing new names for updated NDOs might be sufficient rather than
          using a staleness verification algorithm to manage them. However,
          notifying the new names of updated NDOs to users is not a trivial
          task. Unless the update is informed to all users at the same
          time, some users would use the old name although intending to
          retrieve the updated NDO.</t>

          <t>One research challenge is how to design consistency and coherence
          models for caching NDOs along with their revision handling and
          updating protocols in a scalable manner.</t>

	<section title="Cache Sharing by Multiple Applications">
	  <t>
	    When ICN is deployed as a general, application-independent
	    network and cache infrastructure, multiple consumers and
	    producers (representing different applications) would
	    communicate over the same infrastructure. With universal
	    naming schemes or sufficiently unique hash-based
	    identifiers different application could also share
	    identical NDOs in a transparent way.
	  </t>
	  <t>
	    Depending on the naming, data integrity and data orign
	    authentication approaches, there may be technical and
	    business challenges to share caches across different
	    applications, for example content protection, avoiding
	    cache poisoning, ensuring performance isolation etc. As
	    ICN research matures, these challenges should be addressed
	    more specifically in a dedicated document.

      <section title="Network Management">
        <t>Managing networks has been a core craft in the IP-based
        host-centric paradigm ever since the technology was introduced
        in production networks. However, at the onset of IP,
        management was considered primarily as an add-on. Essential
        tools that are used daily by networkers, such as ping and
        traceroute, did not become widely available until more than a
        decade or so after IP was first introduced. Management
        protocols, such as SNMP, also became available much later than
        the original introduction of IP and many still consider them
        insufficient despite the years of experience we have running
        host-centric networks. Today, when new networks are deployed
        network management is considered a key aspect for any
        operator, a major challenge which is directly reflected in
        higher operational cost if not done well. If we want ICN to be
        deployed in infrastructure networks, development of management
        tools and mechanisms must go hand-in-hand with the rest of the
        architecture design.</t>

        <t>
	  Although defining an FCAPS (fault, configuration,
	  accounting, performance, security) <xref
	  target="ISOIEC-7498-4"/> management model for ICN is clearly
	  outside the scope of this document, there is a need for
	  creating basic tools early on while ICN is still in the
	  design and experimentation phases that can evolve over time
	  and help network operations centers (NOCs) to define
	  policies, validate that they are indeed used in practice, be
	  notified early on about failures, determine and resolve
	  configuration problems. Authentication, Authorization,
	  Accounting (AAA) as well as performance management, from a
	  NOC perspective, will also need to be considered. Given the
	  expectations for a large number of nodes and unprecedented
	  traffic volumes, automating tasks, or even better employing
	  self-management mechanisms are preferred. The main challenge
	  here is that all tools we have at our disposal today are
	  node-centric, end-to-end oriented, or assuming a
	  packet-stream communication environment. Rethinking
	  reachability and operational availability, for example, can
	  yield significant insights into how information-centric
	  networks will be managed in the future.
	</t>

        <t>With respect to network management we see three different
        aspects.  First, any operator needs to manage all resources
        available in the network, which can range from node
        connectivity to network bandwidth availability to in-network
        storage to multi-access support. In ICN, users will also bring
        into the network significant resources in terms of network
        coverage extension, storage, and processing capabilities.
        Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) characteristics should also be
        considered to the degree that this is possible (e.g., content
        dissemination through data mules).  Secondly, given that nodes
        and links are not at the center of an information-centric
        network, network management should capitalize on native ICN
        mechanisms. For example, in-network storage and name
        resolution can be used for monitoring, while native
        publish/subscribe functionality can be used for triggering
        notifications. Finally, management is also at the core of
        network controlling capabilities by allowing operating actions
        to be mediated and decided, triggering and activating
        networking procedures in an optimized way. For example,
        monitoring aspects can be conjugated with different management
        actions in a coordinated way, allowing network operations to
        flow in a concertated manner.</t>

        <t>
	  However, the considerations on leveraging intrinsic ICN
	  mechanisms and capabilities to support management operations
	  go beyond a simple mapping exercise. In fact, not only it
	  raises a series of challenges on its own, but also opens up
	  new possibilities for both ICN and "network management" as a
	  concept. For instance, naming mechanisms are central to ICN
	  intrinsic operations, which are used to identify and reach
	  content under different aspects (e.g., hierarchically
	  structured vs. 'flattish' names). In this way, ICN is
	  decoupled from host-centric aspects on which traditional
	  networking management schemes rely upon.  As such, questions
	  are raised which can directly be translated into challenges
	  for network management capability, such as, for example how
	  to address a node or a network segment in a ICN naming
	  paradigm, how to identify which node is connected "where",
	  how to be aware of the node capabilities (i.e., high or
	  low-powered M2M node) and if there is a host-centric
	  protocol running where the management process can also
	  leverage.
	</t>

        <t>
	  But, on the other hand, these same inherent ICN
	  characteristics also allow us to look into network
	  management through a new perspective. By centering its
	  operations around NDOs, one can conceive new management
	  operations addressing, for example, per-content management
	  or access control, as well as analyzing performance per NDO
	  instead of per link or node. Moreover, such considerations
	  can also be used to manage operational aspects of ICN
	  mechanisms themselves. For example, <xref
	  target="NDN-MGMT"></xref> re-utilizes inherent
	  content-centric capabilities of CCN to manage optimal link
	  connectivity for nodes, in concert with a network
	  optimization process. Conversely, how these content-centric
	  aspects can otherwise influence and impact management in
	  other areas (e.g., security, resilience) is also important,
	  as exemplified in <xref target="CCN-ACCESS"></xref>, where
	  access control mechanisms are integrated into a prototype of
	  the <xref target="PURSUIT"></xref> architecture.
	</t>

        <t>The set of core research challenges on ICN management include: <list style="symbols">
            <t>Management and control of NDO reception at the requestor</t>

            <t>Coordination of management information exchange and control
            between ICN nodes and ICN network control points</t>

            <t>Identification of management and controlling actions and items
            through information naming</t>

            <t>Relationship between NDOs and host entities identification,
            i.e., how to identify a particular link, interface, or flow that
            need to be managed.</t>

      <section title="ICN Applications">
        <t>ICN can be applied to different application domains and is expected
        to provide benefits for application developers by providing a more
        suitable interface for application developers (in addition to the
        other ICN benefits described above). <xref
        target="RFC7476" /> provides an overview of
        relevant application domains at large. This section discusses
        opportunities and challenges for selected application types.</t>

        <section title="Web Applications">
          <t>Intuitively, the ICN request/response communication style seems to
          be directly mappable to web communication over HTTP. NDO names could be
          the equivalent of URIs in today's web, proprietary and transparent
          caching could be obsoleted by ICN in-network caching, and developers
          could directly use an ICN request/response API to build
          applications.</t>

          <t>Research efforts such as <xref target="ICN2014-WEB-NDN"></xref>
          have analysed real-world web applications and ways to implement them
          in ICN. The most significant insight is that, REST-style web
          communication heavily relies on transmitting user/application
          context information in HTTP GET requests, which would have to be
          mapped to corresponding ICN messages. The challenge in ICN would be
          how to exactly achieve that mapping. This could be done to some
          degree by extending name formats or by extending message structure
          to include cookies and similar context information. The design
          decisions would need to consider overhead in routers (if larger
          GET/Interest messages would have to be stored in corresponding
          tables on routers, for example.</t>

          <t>Other challenges include the ability to return different results
          based on requestor-specific processing in the presence on immutable
          objects (and name-object bindings) in ICN and the ability for
          efficient bidirectional communication, which would require some
          mechanism to name and reach requestor applications.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Video Streaming and Download">
          <t>One of ICN's prime application areas is video streaming and
          download where accessing named data, object-level security and
          in-network storage can fulfil requirements for both video streaming
          and download. The applicability and benefits of ICN to video has
          been demonstrated by several prototype developments <xref
          target="ICN2014-AHLGREN-VIDEO-DEMO"></xref>.</t>

          <t><xref target="I-D.irtf-icnrg-videostreaming"></xref>
          discusses the opportunities and challenges for implementing
          today's' video services such as DASH-based streaming and
          download over ICN, considering performance requirements,
          relationship to peer-to-peer live streaming, IPTV and
          Digital Rights Management (DRM).</t>

          <t>In addition to just porting today's video application from a host-centric paradigm
          to ICN there are also promising opportunities to leverage the ICN
          network services for redesigning and thus significantly enhancing
          video access and distribution <xref
          target="ICNRG-2015-01-WESTPHAL"></xref>. For example, ICN store
          and forward could be leveraged for rate adaptation to
          achieve maximum throughput and optimal QoE in scenarios with varying
          link properties, if capacity information is fed back to rate
          selection algorithms at senders. Other optimizations such as more
          aggressive prefetching could be performed in the network by
          leveraging visibility of chunk NDO names and NDO metadata in the
          network. Moreover, multi-source rate adaptation in combination with
          network coding could enable better quality of experience, for
          example in multi-interface/access scenarios where multiple paths
          from client to upstream caches exist <xref target="RFC7476" />.</t>
        </section>

<section title="Internet of Things">
          <t>The essence of ICN lies in the name based routing that enables
          users to retrieve NDOs by the names regardless of their locations.
          By the definition, ICN is suitable well for IoT applications, where
          users consume data generated from IoTs without maintaining secure
          connections to them. The basic put/get style APIs of ICN enable
          developers to build IoT applications in a simple and fast
          manner.</t>

          <t>
	    On-going efforts such as <xref
	    target="I-D.lindgren-icnrg-efficientiot"></xref>, <xref
	    target="I-D.zhang-iot-icn-challenges"></xref>, <xref
	    target="ICN2014-NDNWILD"></xref> have addressed the
	    requirements and challenges of ICN for IoT. For instance,
	    many IoT applications depend on a PUSH model where data
	    transmission is initiated by the publisher, and so they
	    can support various real-time applications: emergency
	    alarm, etc. However, ICN does not support the PUSH model
	    in a native manner due to its inherent receiver-driven
	    data transmission mechanism. The challenge would be how to
	    efficiently support the PUSH model in ICN, and so it
	    provides publish/subscribe style APIs for IoT application
	    developers. This could be done by introducing other types
	    of identifiers such as a device identifier or by extending
	    the current request/response communication style, which
	    may result in heavy overhead in ICN routers.
	  </t>

          <t>
	    Moreover, key characteristics of the ICN underlying
	    operation also impact important aspects of IoT, such as
	    the caching in content storage of network forwarding
	    entities. This allows the simplification of ICN-based IoT
	    application development, since the network is able to act
	    on named content, generic names provide a way to address
	    content independently of the underlying device (and
	    access) technology, and bandwidth consumption is optimized
	    due to the availability of cached content. However, these
	    aspect raise challenges themselves, concerning the
	    freshness of the information received from the cache in
	    contrast to the last value generated by a sensor, as well
	    as pushing content to specific nodes (e.g., for
	    controlling them), which requires individual addressing
	    for identification. In addition, due to the heterogeneous
	    nature of IoT nodes, their processing capabilities might
	    not be able to handle the necessary content signing
	    verification procedures.
